# zabbix-5-old-version-1_6-theme

Hello! here is what u want to do:

1. Download the two files: (oldisnew.css) and (table_head2.gif).
2. On your Zabbix server CLI there should be a directory called /usr/share/zabbix/assets/styles/. Put the 2 files here.
3. Now, at the Zabbix GUI navigate to Profile under User settings and change the theme.
4. Enjoy your new theme!
